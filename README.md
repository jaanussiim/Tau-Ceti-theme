# Tau Ceti theme for AppCode

Tau Ceti is a custom, alternative color scheme for the JetBrains AppCode Objective-C IDE. It comes with beautiful, carfully selected colors to boost up your coding experience. I did not feel comfortable with any of the bundled schemes so I created this one on my own. The name Tau Ceti is derived from the star system with the same name. It's also the name of science fiction themed computer game which I played on my C64 when I was a child.

# Customized Syntax highlighting

AppCode offers a thousand settings to customize nearly every aspect of it's appearance. This is exactly what I did. In addition to support for C/C++/Objective-C, I added customized syntax highlighting for CocoaPods, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, RegExp, XML and XPath. General color settings and language defaults have been modified to fit to Tau Ceti, as well as console and diff colors.

# Installation

Close AppCode, copy the file to AppCode's color scheme dir with Terminal.

	 cp Tau\ Ceti.icls ~/Library/Preferences/appCode20/colors/

Restart Appcode. Make sure the IDE theme `Darcula` is selected under `IDE settings > Appearance`. Tau Ceti is optimized for a dark IDE. Now navigate to `Editor > Colors and Fonts` and select `Tau Ceti` from the schemes dropdown menu. That's it. Enjoy!
