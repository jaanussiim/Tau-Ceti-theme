# Tau Ceti theme for AppCode

Tau Ceti is a custom, alternative color scheme for the JetBrains AppCode Objective-C IDE. It comes with beautiful, carefully selected colors to boost up your coding experience and productivity. I did not feel comfortable with any of the bundled schemes so I created this one on my own. The name Tau Ceti is derived from the star system with the same name. It's also the name of a science fiction themed computer game which I played on my Commodore 64 when I was a child.

# Customized Syntax highlighting

AppCode offers a thousand settings to customize nearly every aspect of it's appearance. It would be a shame not to perceive these opportunities. So Tau Ceti is handcrafted to beautifully colorize C/C++/Objective-C, but in addition, it comes with customized syntax highlighting for CocoaPods, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, RegExp, XML and XPath, console and diff colors.

# Installation

Close AppCode, copy the file to AppCode's color scheme dir with Terminal.

	 cp Tau\ Ceti.icls ~/Library/Preferences/appCode20/colors/

Restart Appcode. Make sure the IDE theme `Darcula` is selected under `IDE settings > Appearance`. Tau Ceti is optimized for a dark IDE. Now navigate to `Editor > Colors and Fonts` and select `Tau Ceti` from the schemes dropdown menu. That's it. Enjoy!

# IntelliJ IDEA

In the wake of overwhelming feedback for Tau Ceti and due to numerous requests, I created a version that's fully compatible with IntelliJ IDEA. It will highlight all above-mentioned syntax but further comes with support for Java and Groovy: [Tau Ceti IntelliJ IDEA edition](http://cl.ly/30171V250j0S). Note I'm not a Java Developer and I don't use IDEA myself, so this variant is not officially supported and no part of this repository.
